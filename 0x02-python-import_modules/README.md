Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
Why Python programming is awesome
How to import functions from another file
How to use imported functions
How to create a module
How to use the built-in function dir()
How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
How to use command line arguments with your Python programs
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc

Tasks
0. Import a simple function from a simple file
mandatory

Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

You have to use print function with string format to display integers
You have to assign:
the value 1 to a variable called a
the value 2 to a variable called b
and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__, like the example below
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ cat add_0.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
def add(a, b):
    """My addition function

    Args:
        a: first integer
        b: second integer

    Returns:
        The return value. a + b
    """
    return (a + b)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./0-add.py
1 + 2 = 3
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ cat 0-import_add.py
__import__("0-add")
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ python3 0-import_add.py
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$

1. My first toolbox!
mandatory

Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.

Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
You have to define:
the value 10 to a variable a
the value 5 to a variable b
and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions (including print)
a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 10 and another b = 5
Your program should call each of the imported functions. See example below for format
the word calculator_1 should be used only once in your file
You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
Your code should not be executed when imported
